**Project Overview**

This project provides a platform for managing and visualizing information about Instagram app releases. It consists of a backend API built with NestJS and a frontend interface created with React/Next.js.

**Technologies**

- Backend: NestJS (JavaScript framework for building scalable server-side applications)
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL document database)
- Frontend: React/Next.js (JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces and server-rendered applications)
- Containerization: Docker (platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in containers)
- Orchestration: Docker Compose (tool for defining and running multi-container applications)

**Architecture**

The project follows a microservices architecture, separating backend and frontend concerns. The backend API serves as the data source, providing endpoints for managing Instagram release data. The frontend interacts with the API to display and manage versions and variants.

**Backend (NestJS)**

**Endpoints:**

- `/seed` (POST): Scrapes the latest Instagram releases from [https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/instagram/instagram-instagram/) and saves relevant data to the database:
  - Fetches the last 10 non-alpha/beta releases.
  - Stores release data in the `versions` collection.
  - Scrapes details pages of each version, extracting variants and saving them in the `variants` collection.
- `/versions` (GET): Retrieves a list of all versions from the `versions` collection.
- `/versions/:id` (GET): Retrieves a specific version by ID along with its associated variants from the `versions` and `variants` collections.
- `/versions/:id` (PATCH): Updates a specific version's data in the `versions` collection.
- `/versions/:id` (DELETE): Deletes a specific version along with its associated variants from the `versions` and `variants` collections.
- `/variants` (GET): Retrieves a list of all variants from the `variants` collection.
- `/variants/:id` (GET): Retrieves a specific variant by ID from the `variants` collection.
- `/variants/:id` (PATCH): Updates a specific variant's data in the `variants` collection.
- `/variants/:id` (DELETE): Deletes a specific variant from the `variants` collection.

**MongoDB Collections:**

- `versions`:
  - `_id` (ObjectID): Unique identifier for the version.
  - `versionId` (String): Version string obtained from the scraping.
  - `href` (String): URL of the scraped release page.
  - `releaseDate` (Date): Release date of the version.
  - `variantCount` (Number): Total number of variants associated with the version.
- `variants`:
  - `_id` (ObjectID): Unique identifier for the variant.
  - `versionId` (String): Reference ID to the parent version.
  - `variantId` (String): Variant identifier obtained from the scraping.
  - `arc` (String): Architecture (e.g., arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a).
  - `minSdk` (Number): Minimum supported Android SDK version.
  - `dpi` (String): Screen density (e.g., xxxhdpi).

**Data Flow**

1. The `/seed` endpoint triggers a scrape job.
2. The scraping process fetches the latest Instagram releases from the target URL.
3. Non-alpha/beta releases are extracted and stored in the `versions` collection.
4. Release details pages are scraped for each version.
5. Details about variants (architecture, min SDK, dpi) are extracted and saved in the `variants` collection, linking them to their respective versions.

**Frontend (React/Next.js)**

**Components:**

- `SeedButton`: Triggers a backend call to the `/seed` endpoint for data scraping.
- `VersionList`: Displays a list of versions with details like version string, release date, and variant count.
- `VersionCard`: Renders individual versions within the list, providing actions for deletion and navigation to details pages.
- `VersionDetails`: Presents details of a specific version, including version string, release date, and a list of its variants.
- `VariantList`: Displays a list of variants associated with a specific version.

**User Interaction:**

- Users can initiate scraping of new Instagram APK releases by clicking the "Seed" button.
- The version list allows users to view basic details of each release.
- Users can delete a version and its associated variants directly from the list.
- Clicking on a version card takes the user to the version details page.
- The version details page displays more information about the specific version and its variants.

**Deployment (Docker Compose)**

The project utilizes Docker Compose to streamline deployment and ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production. A `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services involved:

```yaml
version: '3.5'

services:
  db:
    image: mongo:6.0
    container_name: mongodb
    restart: always
    ports:
      - '27017:27017'
    environment:
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: admin # DATABASE_USER
      MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: admin # DATABASE_PASS
    volumes:
      - ./mongo-config:/data/configdb
      - ./mongo-data:/data/db

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: dev.Dockerfile
    container_name: api
    environment:
      DATABASE_NAME: scrape # DATABASE_NAME
      DATABASE_USER: admin # DATABASE_USER
      DATABASE_PASS: admin # DATABASE_PASS
      DATABASE_URI: mongodb://db:27017 # DATABASE_URI, example: mongodb://database:27017
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    depends_on:
      - db
    volumes:
      - ./backend/src:/app/src

  frontend:
    container_name: react
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      dockerfile: dev.Dockerfile
    environment:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL: http://localhost:3000
      API_URL: http://backend:3000
    volumes:
      - ./frontend/app:/app/app
      - ./frontend/public:/app/public
      - ./frontend/.env:/app/.env
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 3001:3000
    depends_on:
      - backend
```

**Explanation:**

1. Three services are defined: `backend`, `frontend`, and `mongo`.
2. The `backend` service builds the NestJS application and exposes port 3000.
3. The `frontend` service builds the React/Next.js application and exposes port 3001. It depends on the `backend` service to be available.
4. The `mongo` service uses the official `mongo:latest` image, exposes port 27017 for MongoDB access, and mounts a volume for persistent data storage.
5. A volume named `mongodb-data` is defined to persist MongoDB data across container restarts.

**Development Setup**

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
3. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up` to start all services in development mode.
4. Access the backend API at `http://localhost:3000` (optional for testing).
5. Access the frontend application at `http://localhost:3001`.
